#Hey! 

Thanks for checking out my repository. I built this tool for folks out there who might want to pool product images for use in rnns or something like that. Who knows!


##How to use it:

first, you need to make sure you have node installed [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
after you download the zip archive, navigate to the directory containing amascraper.js in your console.
type npm install and give it a couple of minutes- the dependencies are very large.

once it's all good type in 

> node amascraper.js searchTerm outputFileName

where searchTearm is the term for the item you're looking for and outputFileName will be the JSON file outputted. 

Simple as that!

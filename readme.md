# Hey! 

Thanks for checking out my repository. I built this tool for folks out there who might want to pool product images for use in rnns or something like that. Who knows!


## How to use it:

first, you need to make sure you have node installed [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

after you download the zip archive, navigate to the directory containing amascraper.js in your console.

type npm install and give it a couple of minutes- the dependencies are very large.

to use it type:

> node amascraper.js searchTerm outputFileName

into your console where searchTearm is the term for the item you're looking for and outputFileName will be the JSON file outputted (optional, defaults to searchTerm). Your images will be in a folder named after your search term. if you don't include a query parameter, I hope you like pants! cause you're gonna have fifty pictures of them without a query string!
